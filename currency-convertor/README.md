# Custom React Hook
In React, a [custom hook](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) is a JavaScript function that allows you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. Custom hooks leverage the built-in React hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.) to share common logic without repeating it in every component.
